Problem Analysis:
We decided to create three classes, one for Critters, one for Towers, and one for Maps. We could then create a variety of critters & towers with properties like health & speed or power & range to be placed on a variety of maps. There are several default critter & tower types (e.g: Fast Critter, Ballista Tower) and there is a MapMaker program that allows the user to create a map via the terminal.

Critters move along the path according to their speed, moving from the entrance to the exit. Towers shoot at the critters if they are in range, dealing damage until they kill a critter.

For more specifics on the implementation of the towers and critters, check their corresponding ReadMes in the MapObjects folder.
