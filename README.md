## Project Overview
This program is a tower defense game where players strategically place towers to defend against waves of critters moving along a predefined path. The game is designed to be modular, allowing for the creation of custom maps.

## Features
- **Critters**: Entities with properties like health and speed that move along the path from the entrance to the exit. Different types of critters (e.g., Fast Critter) provide varying challenges.
- **Towers**: Defensive structures with attributes such as power and range. Towers attack critters within their range, dealing damage until the critters are eliminated. Various tower types (e.g., Ballista Tower) are available.
- **Maps**: Customizable game boards where critters traverse a path.

## Gameplay Mechanics
1. Critters spawn at the entrance of the map and move along the path toward the exit based on their speed.
2. Towers are placed strategically to intercept critters. They attack critters within their range, reducing their health until they are defeated.
3. The game ends when all critters are eliminated or when critters successfully reach the exit.

## Customization
- **Critters and Towers**: The program includes several default critter and tower types, but users can extend these classes to create new types with unique properties.

## Additional Documentation
For more details on the implementation of critters, towers, and maps, refer to the corresponding README files in the each folder.
